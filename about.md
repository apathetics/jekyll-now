I am a second-year computer science/pre-med student at the University of Texas at Austin.

I'm mostly interested in the cybersecurity aspect of computer science especially the way it approaches discovering vulnerabilities and exploiting those weaknesses even in the most fortified defenses. It is both at once a jack-of-all-trades and specialization of being able to explore the restricted sections of the virtual world. In addition, I'm also interested in researching artificial intelligence in the areas of neural networks and machine learning because I believe that replicating the effect of learning in technology would make it incredibly more efficient for society, allowing many scientists to use the untapped potential of machines to advance the world even further. 

When it comes to medicine, I'm mostly interested in the practice of surgery, specifically trauma or emergency surgery. It is not necessarily the nuance or detail in trauma surgery that interests me, but the idea of using the environment and being resourceful - adapting to the world to survive that intrigues me. It requires a certain way of thinking that keeps you on your toes in the same way that cybersecurity would require. Ideally, I aim to integrate medicine and computer science in order to create technology that would create an intuitive interface that could be used to treat the most common problems encountered in healthcare all over both the developed and developing world without being limited by the number and resource of medical professionals.
