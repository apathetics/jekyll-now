**What on earth did I do this past week?**

  This week was still spent on learning how to make vector manipulation more elegant. For example, we learned to remember to take an entire local copy or reference in and simply swap the elements inside the vector. By making these constructors, we're able to have built in copies that is a lot more efficient than making a copy, transfering each element individually and then having to destroy multiple copies. Other than that, the week was mostly spent trying to finish my Darwin project which was a lot more time-consuming than I thought it'd be. My partner and I had started it off with getters and setters method, but after we spent a lot of time trying to get that work, we realized that implementing it without getters and setters would be a lot more difficult with how we set up the grid. So, instead, we had to spend time redesigning the entire process. Which took a while. Other than that, the week was spent having zero sleep because of an OS exam on Wed which I hopefully did well on. Then, I had another exam on Thursday, and had to go straight to finishing my OOP project after that. Ended up sleeping through several alarms and missed Friday because of that. :'(
  
**What is that ominously black cloud on the horizon?**

 Not much to worry about at the moment! Just have an OS project to finish this Friday. Casually work on Life in the mean time. Hopefully get caught up on what I missed on Friday. I'm a little worried about how the next OOP exam would look since my grade depends on it. When should I start studying? After every class? What should I be focusing on? I have an idea, but still a little uncertain. 

**What to do next week?**

  OS Project on VM. Keep reading for OS. Work on OOP. Take a closer look at OOP concepts and play around with them. 

**Play of the Week**

  If anyone is interested in starting or following an ARG (alternate-reality game), or you're simply just interested. The Sombra ARG from Overwatch has finally concluded this weekend (with questionably little resolution) and led to her reveal at Blizzcon! This is an interesting little read in the kinds of puzzles that might involve playing an ARG, and the sense of community that it can create. It's comprised of interesting little puzzles that keep leading to clues and more clues. 
  
  It's an interesting way to expose the world to the idea of a hacker (albeit in a still rather generic and stereotypical manner). And how technology can come to rule our world, and through controlling technology, one can also control the world. Information is everything.
